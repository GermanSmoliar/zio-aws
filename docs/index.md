Low-level AWS wrapper for [ZIO](https://zio.dev) for _all_ AWS services using the AWS Java SDK v2.

The goal is to have access to all AWS functionality for cases when only a simple, direct access is
needed from a ZIO application, or to be used as a building block for higher level wrappers around specific services.
